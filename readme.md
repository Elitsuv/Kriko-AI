# 🏏 Kriko - AI Hand Cricket

**Kriko** is an AI-powered Hand Cricket player built with Python and NumPy. Play against a smart AI that learns your bowling and batting patterns (1-6) and adapts its own strategy!


## 🚀 Features

- **Smart AI**: Predicts your moves using NumPy to make intelligent batting decisions.
- **Adaptive Learning**: The AI subtly adjusts its strategy based on the numbers you bowl most frequently.
- **Simple Gameplay**: You bowl by entering a number (1-6), and the AI "bats" with a number.
- **Out Condition**: If your bowled number matches the AI's batted number, the AI is out.
- **Scoring**: If the numbers don't match, the AI scores the number it "batted."
- **Lightweight**: Built with standard Python libraries and NumPy, requiring minimal dependencies.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Play directly in your terminal for a nostalgic, text-based gaming experience.
